# Agent rules

## Q9 compiler routes must be JVM-free

- Q9 callers use `bin/amu check ... --jvm-free` and
  `bin/amu compile ... --jvm-free`.
- `--jvm-free` must never invoke `java`, `javac`, `clojure`, `clj`,
  `resolveWithJvm`, a Clojure main namespace or another JVM launcher.
- Missing/stale dependency locks, unsupported commands/targets and project
  linker gaps fail closed. Do not silently remove `--source-path`, ignore a
  module lock or fall back to the JVM to make a component compile.
- New Q9 compiler/test routes use nbb/CLJS, Node, native or Wasm. Existing JVM
  suites are compatibility diagnostics and are not Q9 acceptance evidence.
- Preserve tests that shadow forbidden JVM executables and verify that no
  marker was written on both unsupported-route and lock-failure paths.
