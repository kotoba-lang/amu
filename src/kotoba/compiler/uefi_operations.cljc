  "boot: which target may name the UEFI firmware boundary.

  `kotoba.compiler.frontend` admits privileged operations by arity and by
  nothing else -- it has never seen a target keyword, which is why
  `kernel-write-cr3` is admitted for `x86_64-linux-kotoba-v1` too. That was
  survivable while every privileged operation named an instruction a kernel
  runs on its own machine. It is not survivable for these four.

  `kernel-system-table` reads a context slot that only the two-arity EFI entry
  shim writes; under any other entry contract it reads a zero and every
  address derived from it is a wild pointer. `kernel-load-ptr` is an unchecked
  64-bit read. `kernel-uefi-call2` calls through a pointer read out of
  firmware memory. `kernel-jump-to` does not return. Outside the target whose
  entry contract establishes the boundary, none of them means anything, and
  the failure mode of all four is a machine that faults rather than a compile
  that refuses.

  So this is the target gate, and it lives here rather than in the frontend
  because this is the layer that sees a target keyword next to a module. Both
  compile routes call it -- `kotoba.compiler.core` on the JVM and
  `kotoba.compiler.nbb.cli` on the JDK-free one -- because a gate on one route
  is not a gate."

  ⚠ IT STOPPED BEING CORRECT ON 2026-09-09 and the split is why this is its
  own name. The literals gained an AArch64 answer (`adr`); the function
  address did not, because `kotoba.mir` still refuses `:gmir/function-address`
  there under its own keyword, `:function-address-target-mismatch`. Widening
  one gate for both would have admitted here what the next layer refuses --
  a green `amu check` followed by a red `amu compile`, which is the exact skew
  this repository's deps comments already warn about.

  ⚠ THE GAP CLOSED THE SAME DAY, and this docstring keeps the paragraph
  above rather than deleting it because the SEQUENCE is the point. The split
  is what let the literal's gate move on its own evidence while this one
  stayed put for a few hours; a single gate for both would have moved them

;; THE AIUEOS FIRMWARE AND KERNEL TARGETS were always here. What the backend
;; needs is a `.text` the pool can sit at the end of, with no dynamic loader
;; to relocate it -- and a kernel image resolves its own labels exactly as a
;; firmware image does.
;;
;; THE HOSTED NATIVE TARGETS JOINED THEM, because the premise that excluded
;; them was not true. A literal pool is a place in a CONTIGUOUS MAPPING that
;; holds the code, and a hosted target has one: the kexe loader mmaps the code
;; buffer and jumps into it, so a pool the layout pass placed beside the code
;; is reachable exactly as it is inside an image. The loader's own context
;; carries `code_base` and `code_length`.
;;
;; ⚠ THE ISA CONDITION IS GONE, and that is the second half of the same day's
;; measurement rather than an oversight. It said x86-64 because the refusal in
;; `kotoba.mir` said AArch64's answer was ADRP+ADD and its 4 KiB page split
;; was unmodelled. The named blocker was the wrong instruction: `adr` reaches
;; +/-1 MiB in one, and kotoba-native's pool is in the same emitted buffer as
;; the code, which bounds the distance by the size of one program. Both
;; refusals are gone in the pins this file names.
;;
;; WHY IT WAS WORTH WIDENING: the IQ quantization formats decode through
;; codebook grids of 256, 512 or 1024 entries that belong to the FORMAT.
;; Without a pool those types stay in the C -- which is what kotoba-native's
;; elf64 docstring says in as many words -- and the direction is Kotoba and
