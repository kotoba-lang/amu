  "CID-pinned module resolution.

  `project-files` resolves `(:require [app.util :as u])` by turning the
  namespace into a PATH and looking for a file under the source roots. That is
  ambient: what a build compiles depends on what happens to be on disk, so the
  same source can compile to two different artifacts on two machines and
  neither build can say which inputs it actually used.

  Here a module is resolved through a lock instead. The lock names every module
  in the closed graph by CID; bytes are read from a content-addressed block
  directory and are rejected unless they hash to the CID that was asked for.
  There is no path search and no fallback: a `:require` for a namespace the
  lock does not pin is an error, not a reason to go looking.

  This is the Nix-shaped half of content addressing -- pinned, verified,
  reproducible INPUTS -- and it is deliberately separate from the semantic
  definition CIDs in `kotoba-lang/codebase`, which identify checked
  definitions. A source-tree CID says which bytes were compiled. A definition
  CID says what a definition MEANS. Conflating them would let a comment change
  invalidate a definition identity, or let two different sources claim one."
