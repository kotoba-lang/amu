  "Fail-closed checked-KIR to EVM bytecode lowering.

  The first vertical slice owns one Ethereum ABI surface: a pure, zero-arity
  `main() -> int64`.  It intentionally rejects storage, calls, capabilities,
  parameters, additional functions, and every KIR expression outside bounded
  i64 literals, addition, and multiplication.  The emitted creation bytecode
  deploys a conventional EVM runtime with a selector dispatcher, ABI-word
  return, and revert-on-unknown-selector behavior."

;; This file is .cljc, so it claims both runtimes. Until 2026-08-25 the two
;; functions below were written only for the JVM and the claim was false in
;; three separate ways, none of which the JVM suite could see:
;;
;;   1. `Long/MIN_VALUE` is not a symbol ClojureScript can resolve, so the
;;      namespace did not even LOAD there -- measured with the resolved
;;      classpath, the only one of amu's fifteen .cljc namespaces that failed.
;;      Its neighbours use the same constant and load fine because theirs sit
;;      inside `#?(:clj ...)`, which the cljs reader strips before it is read.
;;   2. `integer?` does not recognise a JS bigint, and on ClojureScript every
;;      .kotoba integer VALUE is a bigint (`kotoba.kir.cljs-i64`'s docstring
;;      states this and gives the reason: plain cljs numbers are doubles and
;;      lose precision above 2^53). So `i64?` would have answered false for
;;      every literal it was handed.
;;   3. cljs bitwise ops coerce to int32, so `unsigned-bit-shift-right` by 56
;;      is a shift by 24 -- `56 & 31`. That one is the dangerous kind: it
;;      returns a number rather than failing, and would have emitted wrong
;;      PUSH8 operands silently.
;;
;; Both branches are held to byte-for-byte identity by
;; `test/nbb/run.cljs`'s evm case against the JVM's pinned bytes.
