  DISCARDED both, which is why a Kotoba program compiled for this target could
  not reach the console, boot services or the memory map, and why aiueos's
  BOOTX64.EFI is still C.

  The two-arity shim parks them in the hidden context at +0x50 and +0x58 --
  where `kernel-boot-info` and `kernel-system-table` read them -- AND passes
  them positionally in RDI and RSI, which is where the internal Kotoba ABI
  takes its first two parameters. Both, deliberately: the entry reads them as
  parameters, and anything it calls reads them out of the context without
  having to thread them through every signature.

  Neither shim is a claim that the internal lowering is Microsoft x64. It is
  not; this is the adapter that makes that irrelevant."

;; validated, sealed into `:limits :fuel` and `:fuel-abi :initial`, and then
;; the one place that decides what the machine actually gets ignored it.
;;
;; Measured 2026-09-03: `--fuel 512` and `--fuel 1048576` produce
;; BYTE-IDENTICAL images (sha256 fc742834811b3118...), a 2048x difference that
;; changes nothing. `--fuel 250000000` was refused, so the flag was reaching
;; the verifier; it simply never reached the image. Found by the LOADER stream
;; from the other end, where `sha256-region` costs 1,772 fuel per 64-byte
;; block, so ONE SHA-256 BLOCK could not fit in 512 and the loader's
;; `integrity` module had never returned. Four in-guest boots bisected it
;; before the cause was known -- scratch write/read-back, a 64-byte
;; `kernel-subregion` of a `bytes-literal`, `store32`/`load32` and `sha-init`
;; all pass, and only `sha-block` fails.
;;
;; This is the same class as the imm32 replenish ceiling one layer down
;; (kotoba-native ADR 0078): a budget that cannot be raised past 2^31, and a
;; budget that is silently ignored, are both "the number the machine runs on is
;; not the number anybody wrote".
;;
;; The two checks are `kotoba.native.elf64/artifact-fuel`'s, restated rather
;; than shared because this repository owns the PE32+ route and that one owns
;; ELF: the budget must be a positive integer, and `:limits :fuel` must AGREE
;; with `:fuel-abi :initial`. The agreement check is what makes this a seam
;; rather than a second opinion -- the verifier re-derives `:fuel-abi` from
;; `:limits`, so a packager that read one of the two could ship an image whose

(defn package-embedded-kernel
  "Generate a position-independent PE32+ UEFI transition loader around a
  compiler-produced aiueos kernel ELF. No C object, CRT, import, or linker is
  involved. The current hard-flip contract admits exactly two bounded PT_LOAD
  segments and transfers control after ExitBootServices.

  ⚠ NOT PORTABLE, measured 2026-08-31. This function emits different bytes
  under ClojureScript than under the JVM. Given one identical kernel it
  produced 129,024 bytes on both, differing in exactly two, inside an
  eight-byte run the JVM writes as `AIUEBOOT` and cljs as a NUL followed by
  `HUEBOOT`; read as one little-endian word the two differ by 321. Both routes reported
  the same kernel sha256, so both had read the same input.

  `package-efi` in this same namespace IS byte-identical across the two, so
  this is one function, not the file. That is also why `bin/amu`'s JDK-free
  route serves `--target x86_64-aiueos-uefi-v1` and refuses
  `package-aiueos-boot`: the boot command was implemented on that route,
  measured, and reverted rather than shipped.

  No test guards this, and one cannot be written here. Clojure and nbb each
  load their own runtime; a comparison has to build the same input under BOTH
  and diff the bytes, which is what aiueos's
  `os/aiueos/scripts/verify-jvm-free-object-parity.cljs` does for kernel
  objects. Whoever narrows this down should do the same for the boot image.

  This file has ZERO reader conditionals. That was taken as evidence it was
  portable; it is evidence that nobody wrote one. Suspect the arithmetic --
  cljs bitwise operators truncate to int32, and the values here (entry points,
  paddrs, segment sizes) are 64-bit. See aiueos ADR-0130."
