  The two-arity shim parks them in the hidden context at +0x50 and +0x58 --
  where `kernel-boot-info` and `kernel-system-table` read them -- AND passes
  them positionally in RDI and RSI, which is where the internal Kotoba ABI
  takes its first two parameters. Both, deliberately: the entry reads them as
  parameters, and anything it calls reads them out of the context without
  having to thread them through every signature.

  Neither shim is a claim that the internal lowering is Microsoft x64. It is
  not; this is the adapter that makes that irrelevant."

  ⚠ NOT PORTABLE, measured 2026-08-31. This function emits different bytes
  under ClojureScript than under the JVM. Given one identical kernel it
  produced 129,024 bytes on both, differing in exactly two, inside an
  eight-byte run the JVM writes as `AIUEBOOT` and cljs as a NUL followed by
  `HUEBOOT`; read as one little-endian word the two differ by 321. Both routes reported
  the same kernel sha256, so both had read the same input.

  `package-efi` in this same namespace IS byte-identical across the two, so
  this is one function, not the file. That is also why `bin/amu`'s JDK-free
  route serves `--target x86_64-aiueos-uefi-v1` and refuses
  `package-aiueos-boot`: the boot command was implemented on that route,
  measured, and reverted rather than shipped.

  No test guards this, and one cannot be written here. Clojure and nbb each
  load their own runtime; a comparison has to build the same input under BOTH
  and diff the bytes, which is what aiueos's
  `os/aiueos/scripts/verify-jvm-free-object-parity.cljs` does for kernel
  objects. Whoever narrows this down should do the same for the boot image.

  This file has ZERO reader conditionals. That was taken as evidence it was
  portable; it is evidence that nobody wrote one. Suspect the arithmetic --
  cljs bitwise operators truncate to int32, and the values here (entry points,
  paddrs, segment sizes) are 64-bit. See aiueos ADR-0130."
