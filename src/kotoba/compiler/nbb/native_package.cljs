  "Artifact packaging for the JDK-free native driver.

  `kotoba.compiler.nbb.cli` sealed a `:kotoba.kexe/v1` artifact and wrote it
  out as EDN, full stop. The JVM CLI does one more thing for the aiueos target
  profiles: it hands that same sealed artifact to an ELF64 or PE32+ packager
  and writes THOSE bytes to `--output`. Nothing about that step needs a JVM --
  `kotoba.native.elf64` and `kotoba.compiler.packaging.pe32plus` are portable
  `.cljc` that load unchanged under nbb -- it simply had no caller on this
  route. That absence is the whole reason `os/aiueos` built every one of its
  67 kernel objects through `clojure`.

  Kept out of `cli.cljs` deliberately: that namespace is shared with the Wasm
  driver, which must not pay to load two native packagers it will never call.
  The ISA entrypoint supplies `package` the same way it supplies
  `emit-program`."

  "`kotoba.native.elf64` is a TWIN: a `.clj` the JVM loads and a `.cljc` this
  route loads (kotoba-native ADR-0036), and the ADR keeps them apart on purpose
  -- the live-boot GDT/TSS shim lives only in the JVM file, which also lays the
  kernel RW context at a different offset.

  Measured 2026-08-31 on one source: the x86-64 kernel IMAGE is 65,904 bytes
  here and 110,872 through the JVM. The object, the CPL3 user image, the UEFI
  application and the AArch64 kernel image are byte-identical across both
  routes; this one is not, and it is not a bug to fix here -- the divergence is
  the ADR's decision.

  So it is refused rather than served. Producing a materially different kernel
  image under a flag whose whole value is that it refuses instead of falling
  back would be the exact failure this route was added to remove: a quiet wrong
  answer where the caller asked for an equivalent one."

  "Select and run the packager exactly as `kotoba.compiler.cli`'s `:kexe/v1`
  branch does, and return a Buffer, or nil when the artifact EDN is what
  `--output` should hold.

  The defaulting rule is copied rather than simplified: with no `--artifact`,
  an object is preferred when one exists, and an image is used only for a
  `:process` profile. That is why `--target x86_64-aiueos-kernel-v1` alone
  yields a `.o` (what `bisect-object-migration.sh` hashes) while the UEFI
  image requires `--artifact image` (what `build-kotoba-native-kernel.sh`
  passes)."
