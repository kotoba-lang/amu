  "The value ABI stamped into a native artifact's compatibility descriptor.

  This mirrored only the last two branches. `kotoba.compiler.core` (the JVM
  compiler), `kotoba.compiler.nbb.wasm-cli` and `kotoba.verifier` all select
  from FOUR, so any program carrying floating point compiled through this
  JDK-free driver stamped `:kotoba.typed/externref-v1` while the verifier
  re-derived `:kotoba.typed/mixed-f64-v2` and refused the artifact with
  `native compatibility metadata rejected` -- a diagnostic that names the
  metadata rather than the missing branch, so it reads as an unsupported
  program rather than a driver that cannot describe it.

  Measured 2026-08-30: a `vector-f64` module reached this path and was refused
  exactly so. It is not vector-specific; `uses-f64?` is true for any f64
  literal, since the frontend desugars one into `f64-from-bits`.

  Derived from the KIR rather than the HIR because the KIR is what the
  verifier reads back out of the sealed artifact. `kotoba.compiler.core`
  derives the same answer from the HIR; deriving it here from the value the
  checker actually inspects removes the possibility of the two disagreeing."
