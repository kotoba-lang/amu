  "Resolve a Kotoba package lock (`kotoba.lock.edn`,
  `:kotoba.lock/version 1`) into source roots the project linker can read,
  without a JVM and without the network.

  WHAT THIS IS FOR. `ADR-kotoba-package-cid-lock` (accepted 2026-06-30)
  specified the lock, `kotoba.lang.package-contract` validates it, and the
  conformance corpus exercises it -- but its own maturity list has recorded
  M5, \"`kotoba-lang/registry` or `kotoba-cli` consumes the same suite\", as
  outstanding since the day it was written. Nothing read a lock. A package
  could be published, signed and pinned, and no compiler would look at it, so
  the only way to depend on Kotoba code was to hand `--source-path` a
  directory and hope. This namespace is that missing consumer.

  THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, because two locks now exist and they are not
  competing:

    kotoba.lock.edn      WHO and WHAT MAY IT DO -- package name and version,
    (this file)          repo identity, the commit it came from, the signer
                         DIDs, and the capability grant. Authority.

    kotoba.modules.edn   WHICH BYTES -- every module in the closed graph by
    (module_lock.cljs)   CID, read from a content-addressed block directory.
                         Integrity.

  They compose in that order: a package lock resolves to source roots, the
  linker walks them, and `module-lock` pins the result. Neither subsumes the
  other. A module lock says nothing about who signed the code; a package lock
  says nothing about the bytes of an individual module.

  NO NETWORK, ON PURPOSE. This does not fetch. Dependency trees are read from
  `--packages <dir>`, the way locked module bytes are read from `--blocks`.
  Fetching is the authoring side's job, and keeping it there is what lets a
  build be reproduced on a machine with no credentials and no route out.

  WHAT IS STRICTER HERE THAN IN THE CONTRACT. `:dep/definition-cids` is
  optional in `kotoba.lang.package-contract` -- deliberately, because
  effectful code stays component-addressed until its capability interface is
  in the typed KIR. It is REQUIRED here. The reason is that without it this
  namespace has nothing to check the materialised tree against: the lock's
  `:dep/tree-cid` pins a codebase head this route never computes, and
  `:dep/repo-rid` is a commitment to a URL, not a locator. Admitting a
  directory because it sits at the right path, under a name the lock
  mentions, would be a lock in name only -- the same failure `module_lock`
  refuses when it declines to fall back to a path search. A dep without
  definition CIDs is refused with the command that produces them."
