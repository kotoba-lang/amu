(ns kotoba.compiler.nbb.classpath
  "JVM-free dependency-closure resolution for `bin/kotoba`'s nbb fast path.

  The fast path's *compile* code has never touched the JVM. Its *classpath*
  did: `bin/kotoba` shelled out to `clojure -Spath` purely to locate the
  pinned git dependencies in `~/.gitlibs`. That one call is what made the
  whole path need a JDK — measured directly by stubbing `clojure` out on a
  cold cache, which produced `Could not find namespace: kotoba.artifact.core`
  rather than a resolution error, because the failure returned an empty
  classpath and the caller carried on with a truncated one.

  This resolves the same closure from a checked-in lock and `git`, which is
  all a set of `:git/sha` pins actually needs. A commit id is a content
  address, so the resolution is reproducible without re-deriving it; that is
  also why the lock exists at all rather than a resolver that re-implements
  `tools.deps`. Transitive pins genuinely conflict here — the root pins
  `kotoba-kir` at one commit and three siblings pin three others — and
  choosing between them is `tools.deps`' job, done once at authoring time by
  `scripts/lock-classpath.cljs`. The lock records the answer, not the
  algorithm.

  Maven jars are deliberately absent from the lock. nbb cannot load a `.jar`,
  so they were never part of what this path resolves; recording machine-local
  `~/.m2` paths would make the lock unreproducible for no gain.

  Fail-closed throughout: a lock that does not match `deps.edn`, a checkout at
  the wrong commit, or a missing dependency directory is an error, never a
  shorter classpath."
