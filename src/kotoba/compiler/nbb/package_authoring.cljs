(ns kotoba.compiler.nbb.package-authoring
  "Produce what `kotoba.compiler.nbb.package-lock` consumes: a signed package
  manifest, and a `kotoba.lock.edn` resolved from a dependency declaration.

  WHERE tools.deps FITS, AND WHY IT IS ONLY HERE. Choosing between conflicting
  transitive git pins is a solved problem with an implementation
  (`tools.deps`), and a second resolver written in nbb would be free to
  disagree with the first. So this reuses it -- and confines it to authoring
  time, exactly as `scripts/lock-classpath.cljs` confines it for Amu's own
  classpath. The split is the whole point:

    authoring   `amu package-lock`  resolves a closure, may use a JDK,
                                    writes CID pins into kotoba.lock.edn
    build       `amu compile        reads the lock. No resolver, no network,
                 --package-lock`    no JDK, no path search.

  A commit id is a content address, so once the answer is recorded it can be
  reproduced without re-deriving it. `--jvm-free` therefore REFUSES
  `package-lock` rather than quietly resolving some other way: the honest
  answer to \"resolve this closure without a JDK\" is that this command does
  not, and a fallback that produced a different closure under the same flag
  would be worse than a refusal.

  `package-manifest` needs none of that and runs on nbb alone."
