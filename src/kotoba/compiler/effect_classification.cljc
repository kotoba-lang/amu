(ns kotoba.compiler.effect-classification
  "The classification an effect carries, and the compile-time refusal of an
  effect that carries none.

  Root ADR-2607280100 D5 puts clearance in the language spec AS THE TYPE OF AN
  EFFECT AND NEVER AS THE TYPE OF A VALUE, and gives one reason for choosing
  that boundary: `kotoba/app` has no ambient authority, so the only route out
  of a guest is a typed effect descriptor, and a label that rides on the
  DESCRIPTOR cannot be omitted by a caller. Its problem 3 is exactly that
  omission -- every classification route in this workspace was opt-in, and a
  caller that simply did not pass a classification context was silently
  permitted. A missing declaration and a correct one returned the same value.

  So this namespace does not ask whether a classification was supplied. It
  asks the catalog what the effect IS classified, and REFUSES TO COMPILE when
  the catalog has no answer. There is no flag to turn it off:
  `kotobase.kotobase/authorize-xrpc`'s `classification-required?` (Step 3, pin
  c722fb166b11) is a runtime opt-in, and this is the thing that stops that
  flag from being the only thing between a caller and a fail-open.

  ## What the label means

  `:kotoba.security/classification` on a capability-catalog entry is THE
  CLEARANCE A SUBJECT MUST HOLD to be granted that authority -- the reading
  `kotoba.security.abac` already gives a resource classification in its
  no-read-up rule. It is NOT the classification of any one call's payload: a
  payload label is a runtime fact and this is a static property of the
  authority. `secret/get` cannot be exercised below `:restricted` whatever
  secret is fetched; `hash/sha256` crosses no boundary at all.

  ## One lattice, one judgment

  The four labels are `kotoba.security.information-flow/ranks` (ADR-2607280100
  D1, which exists because there were two copies of that map). This namespace
  defines no rank map, ranks nothing itself, and compares nothing: `join` here
  is `flow/join`, and the no-read-up comparison stays in `abac/evaluate` (D6).
  What is added is REACHABILITY -- abac's `required-rank` reads
  `(:classification resource)`, the compiler had never put one there, and a
  nil required-rank produces no violation. The check was present and could not
  fire.

  ## Unknown labels round in opposite directions

  Following kotobase-peer Step 2 (pin ed3ae49d79ec): an unknown label on the
  OBJECT coerces UP to the most protected level, an unknown label on the
  SUBJECT grants nothing. Rounding a subject up is privilege escalation by
  typo.

    object   `join` is `flow/join`, which coerces an unrecognised label to
             `:restricted`. It is reached by a resource classification a
             CALLER supplied alongside the descriptor's -- the effective
             object label is the join of the two, so a caller can raise the
             classification of its own compilation and can never lower it.
             A label the DESCRIPTOR declares can never reach `join` unranked:
             `check!` refuses it first, which is stricter than rounding up.
    subject  left exactly as written. `abac/evaluate` reads a clearance it
             cannot rank as nil and denies; nothing here substitutes a label
             for it. The silent-safe answer is reported as
             `:unknown-subject-clearance` rather than only being taken --
             `flow/unknown-labels` exists because a silent safe answer
             accumulates.

  ## Two hosts

  On the JVM the declarations are READ from the capability catalog, so a
  capability added there without one cannot be compiled -- drift is loud
  rather than silent. ClojureScript cannot read a classpath resource
  synchronously, so it uses the closed literal below, which is the same shape
  `kotoba.compiler.frontend` already uses for wire ids and is checked against
  the resource by a JVM test."

  deliberate limit rather than an oversight. `abac/evaluate` denies whenever a
  resource classification is present and the subject's rank is nil, and a
  policy that names no subject has a nil rank, so supplying the resource
  classification unconditionally refuses every compilation whose policy names
  no subject. MEASURED 2026-09-10 by making this `(if true ...)` and running
  `clojure -M:test`: 277 failures and 1186 errors, against 0 and 0. Measured
  the same day, NO policy in this repository names a `:clearance` at all --
  `grep -rn :clearance` outside this namespace returns nothing -- so today
  that switch is the difference between a whole suite and none of it.

  Requiring every compiler policy to carry a subject clearance is a decision
  about what a policy must contain. It is not what ADR-2607280100 D5 asks for:
  D5's unconditional half is the DECLARATION, which `check!` enforces with no
  policy involved at all, and which is what closes the ADR's problem 3. The
  unarmed state is reported rather than assumed -- `check` answers
  `:classification/no-read-up :unarmed` -- because an unarmed comparison and a
  comparison that passed both leave `:abac/allowed? true`.

  A resource classification the caller supplied itself is not discarded and
  not preferred: the effective label is `flow/join` of both, so a caller may
  raise its own compilation's classification and can never lower it, and a
  label the lattice cannot rank rounds UP to `:restricted`. The subject's
  clearance is left exactly as written -- see the namespace docstring."
