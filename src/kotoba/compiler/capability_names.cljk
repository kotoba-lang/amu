  "The user-facing spelling of a capability grant.

  `[:cap/call 3]` is the WIRE form. The compiled artifact, KIR, admission and
  the host runtime all agree on that integer, and changing it is an ABI break.
  It is not, however, something a person should have to read or write:
  `lang/capability-catalog.edn` says `:numeric-id :not-user-facing`, and the
  `:implicit-ability-elaboration` stage in `lang/elaboration-pipeline.edn`
  carries the rule `:no-user-facing-numeric-ids`.

  Measured 2026-08-31, the CLI did exactly what those two forbid. A guest with
  one `(hash/sha256 s)` call -- no `:capabilities` clause, no `cap-call`, no
  number anywhere in its source -- was answered with

      :effects #{[:cap/call 3]}
      :admission {:minimal-policy {:allow #{[:cap/call 3]}} ...}

  so writing the `--policy` file it asks for meant looking up that `hash/sha256`
  is 3. Under nbb it was worse than inconvenient: the id is a JavaScript BigInt,
  which prints as `#object[BigInt 3]`, so the `:minimal-policy` the CLI printed
  was not readable EDN and could not be pasted back at all.

  This namespace is that translation, and ONLY that translation. It sits at the
  boundary where the compiler talks to a person:

    - `name-grants` rewrites wire ids to catalog names on the way OUT (what
      `check` prints, and what an error envelope reports).
    - `wire-policy` rewrites catalog names to wire ids on the way IN (what
      `--policy` accepts), before admission and before provenance sees it.

  Nothing between those two boundaries changes. HIR, KIR, admission, the
  emitters and the emitted bytes keep the integer they have always had, so a
  policy file written the old way hashes to the same `:policy-sha256` and
  produces the same artifact, byte for byte.

  A grant whose id is NOT in the catalog is left numeric on the way out. There
  is no name to give it: the only way to reach such an id is to write
  `(cap-call 200 x)` -- a literal integer -- in the guest source, and inventing
  a name for it would be a lie. An id the catalog DOES know is named even when
  the source spelled it numerically, because the name is the more useful of two
  true answers."
