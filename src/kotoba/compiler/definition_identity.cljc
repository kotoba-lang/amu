(ns kotoba.compiler.definition-identity
  "Per-definition content identity for a checked module: one CID per top-level
  function, computed by the compiler after type and effect checking.

  `kotoba.kir.definition-identity` owns the identity itself -- the canonical
  DAG-CBOR encoding, the sealed payload, the refusals. Nothing here re-derives
  any of that. What this namespace owns is the *compiler side* of the
  contract in kotoba-lang `lang/code-identity.edn`: turning the compiler's KIR
  into the six sealed inputs

      [:typed-kir :profile-version :desugar-contract-version
       :effect-row :interface :direct-definition-dependencies]

  and doing so identically on the JVM and under nbb.

  ## Why the compiler has to alpha-normalize before hashing

  Measured 2026-09-02: `kotoba.kir.definition-identity/normalize` is a
  canonical encoder over an EDN value domain, not a binder-aware
  normalization. It maps a symbol to `[\"sym\" <name>]` verbatim. So two
  functions differing only in a local name -- `(fn [a] (+ a 1))` and
  `(fn [b] (+ b 1))` -- hash differently unless the caller renames binders
  first. The contract says `:alpha-normalization :de-bruijn`, so the renaming
  is the compiler's job and it happens here.

  Binders are renamed to `k0`, `k1`, ... in a single left-to-right counter
  that never resets, so the renaming is a function of position alone. The five
  KIR binding forms are `params`, `let`, `result-match-of`, `variant-match`
  and `option-match`; a sixth one added later would leave a source-chosen name
  in the body, so `verify-normalized!` refuses rather than hashing it. That
  refusal is the point: an identity that silently seals a source name is an
  identity two spellings of the same definition disagree about.

  ## Names are not in the hash, on either side of a call

  A callee symbol is replaced by `[:kotoba.definition/ref <cid>]` before the
  body is sealed, so a definition's identity depends on *what it calls*, never
  on *what that thing is called*. This is what makes a rename a cache hit
  rather than a recompile.

  ## Recursion: scc-v1

  A definition inside a cycle cannot name its own CID, so the cycle is hashed
  as a unit. The rule is the one kotoba-lang `lang/code-identity.edn` names
  (`:recursive-groups :scc-v1`) and `kotoba.codebase.typed-code` implements:
  partition into strongly connected components, and inside a component pick
  the member ordering whose canonical bytes are smallest. That is a canonical
  choice made from the bytes, not from the names, so renaming every member of
  a cycle leaves the group identity alone. References to group members become
  `[:kotoba.definition/group <index>]`. A group larger than
  `max-recursive-group` is REFUSED with a marker, never hashed by name:
  the permutation search is factorial and a bound that silently degraded to
  name order would be a different identity wearing the same shape.

  ## What a refusal looks like

  Every function this namespace cannot identify gets an explicit marker
  instead of a CID -- `:definition-cid :unbridged-effect` for a row the
  identity's effect-row bridge refuses, `:dependency-unavailable` for a
  function whose closure contains one, and so on.

  Which rows the bridge refuses moved on 2026-09-03. It used to refuse every
  member that was not `[:cap/call <id>]`, and the tracked control effect
  `:abort` was therefore unbridgeable -- ADR-0300 section 4 recorded that, and
  it is why an aborting function had no identity. kotoba-lang
  `docs/adr/ADR-abort-reaches-the-sealed-effect-row.md` adjudicated it the
  other way: `:abort` is already the sealed vocabulary and passes through
  unchanged, from the closed set `kotoba.kir.definition-identity/control-effects`.
  What still reaches this marker is a wire id no catalog names -- reachable
  only from a literal `(cap-call N x)` in source -- and any keyword outside
  that closed set. See ADR-0326. A marker is not a CID and cannot be
  mistaken for one: `:definitions` carries `:cid` on success and
  `:definition-cid <marker>` on refusal, so a consumer that reads `:cid`
  gets nothing rather than something plausible."

  versions the grammar and the profile; `lang/elaboration-pipeline.edn` names
  the stages; neither numbers the desugar contract. The only place the number
  appears at all is kotoba-lang `lang/code-identity-vectors.edn`, where the
  frozen vectors carry 1 (and one vector carries 2 purely to prove that
  changing it moves the CID).

  So this is 1 because the frozen vectors use 1, not because an authority says
  so. `definition-identity-test/desugar-contract-version-is-pinned-because-no-
  authority-declares-one` pins that choice, with the gap in its name, so the
  day an authority does declare a version this constant is reviewed rather
  than quietly left behind. Until then: every definition CID this compiler
  mints depends on a number nobody owns."

  `:order` is DECLARATION order, and it is reported because it is not
  recoverable from `:entries`: the emitted module lays functions out in
  declaration order, so two modules with the same set of definition CIDs and
  different declaration order emit different bytes (measured 2026-09-02;
  see the ADR). A consumer keying a cache on identity needs the ordered
  sequence, not the set.

  An entry carries `:cid` when the definition has one and
  `:definition-cid <marker>` when it does not. There is no third shape and no
  entry carries both."

  Returns nil when any definition in the module lacks a CID. A partial
  identity is not an identity, and a cache keyed on one would serve one
  module's artifact for another.

  module's EXPORTS, so a caller that needs both the report and the key hashes
  every definition once."
