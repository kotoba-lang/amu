  "Require the guest's output to be exactly what canonical DAG-CBOR would have
   written for the value it denotes.

   The source grammar is closed over byte strings, so a transform can be
   lowered perfectly faithfully and still hand back something the codec never
   produced. Decoding alone does not separate those cases: it rejects
   truncation and trailing bytes, but a non-canonical encoding decodes cleanly
   to the value it denotes -- `18 05` reads as the integer 5 -- so only
   re-encoding shows that DAG-CBOR would have written `05`.

   `ipld.schema` already refuses such an output on its own way in, so this is
   not the difference between accepting and rejecting *there*. It is the
   difference at two other places, and both were open:

   - the receipt. Signing happens here, so without this check the executor
     attests that the module produced these bytes and only afterwards does a
     consumer decide they are not a node. A receipt should not vouch for bytes
     the codec refuses.
   - every consumer that is not `ipld.schema`. The capability is a public
     entry point returning raw output bytes, and the engine path beneath it has
     no codec check at all.

   Being raised here also names the ADL as the source, which a reader throwing
   on its own cannot: that says some CBOR was bad, not whose."
